# Password Generator in React

A tiny project built to explore key React hooks:

- `useState` — to manage UI inputs like password length and options.
- `useEffect` — to regenerate password automatically when inputs change.
- `useCallback` — to memoize expensive functions like generator logic.
- `useRef` — to copy password to clipboard by referencing the input.

## Concepts Practiced
- Controlled form inputs
- DOM access with `useRef`
- Clipboard API usage
- TailwindCSS UI styling

## Learnings
This project helped me get comfortable with React’s core hook ecosystem while keeping the scope manageable.
